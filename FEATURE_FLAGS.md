# Feature Flags Guide

## Overview

This application uses environment-based feature flags to control functionality. Feature flags allow you to enable or disable features without changing code.

## Available Feature Flags

### `REACT_APP_API_ENABLED`

Controls whether the application can make API calls to the backend service.

#### Configuration

```bash
# Enable API calls (default)
REACT_APP_API_ENABLED=true

# Disable API calls
REACT_APP_API_ENABLED=false
```

#### Behavior

**When Enabled (`true`):**
- ‚úÖ Users can submit questions
- ‚úÖ Application makes POST requests to `REACT_APP_API_URL/api/ask`
- ‚úÖ Bot responds with AI-generated answers
- ‚úÖ Citations and sources are displayed
- ‚úÖ Full application functionality

**When Disabled (`false`):**
- üîí API calls are blocked at the application level
- üí¨ Users see an informational message:
  > üîí The API feature is currently disabled. To enable this functionality, please set the REACT_APP_API_ENABLED environment variable to 'true' and restart the application.
- üé® Message is displayed with blue information styling
- ‚ö° No network requests are made
- üí∞ No API costs incurred

#### Use Cases

**Development:**
- Test UI without backend
- Frontend development without API dependency
- Prototype and design work

**Demo/Testing:**
- Show UI to stakeholders before backend is ready
- Test error handling and edge cases
- QA testing of frontend components

**Production:**
- Emergency feature disable during incidents
- Gradual rollout control
- Maintenance mode

**Cost Control:**
- Disable in non-production environments
- Reduce API usage during development
- Control access to expensive AI services

#### Screenshots

**Enabled State:**
```
User: What is the company policy?
Bot: Based on the documentation, here's the policy...
      Sources: [1] company-handbook.pdf
```

**Disabled State:**
```
User: What is the company policy?
Bot: üîí The API feature is currently disabled. To enable this 
     functionality, please set the REACT_APP_API_ENABLED 
     environment variable to 'true' and restart the application.
```

## How to Toggle Feature Flags

### Local Development

1. **Edit `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_ENABLED=false
   ```

2. **Restart development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Production Deployment

#### Vercel
1. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Edit `REACT_APP_API_ENABLED` value
3. Redeploy the application

#### Netlify
1. Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Environment
2. Edit `REACT_APP_API_ENABLED` value
3. Trigger a new deploy

#### AWS Amplify
1. Go to App Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Edit `REACT_APP_API_ENABLED` value
3. Redeploy the application

#### Docker
Pass the environment variable:
```bash
docker run -e REACT_APP_API_ENABLED=false your-image
```

Or use environment file:
```bash
docker run --env-file .env.disabled your-image
```

## Testing Feature Flags

### Test Plan

1. **Test Enabled State:**
   - Set `REACT_APP_API_ENABLED=true`
   - Restart application
   - Submit a question
   - Verify API call is made
   - Verify response is displayed

2. **Test Disabled State:**
   - Set `REACT_APP_API_ENABLED=false`
   - Restart application
   - Submit a question
   - Verify no API call is made
   - Verify informational message is displayed
   - Verify message has blue styling

3. **Test Toggle:**
   - Start with enabled
   - Change to disabled
   - Restart and verify behavior
   - Change back to enabled
   - Restart and verify behavior

## Adding New Feature Flags

To add a new feature flag:

1. **Add to environment files:**
   ```bash
   # .env
   REACT_APP_NEW_FEATURE=true
   ```

2. **Add to application:**
   ```javascript
   const NEW_FEATURE_ENABLED = process.env.REACT_APP_NEW_FEATURE === 'true';
   ```

3. **Implement feature check:**
   ```javascript
   if (NEW_FEATURE_ENABLED) {
     // Feature code
   } else {
     // Fallback or message
   }
   ```

4. **Document in this file**

## Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ Always provide fallback behavior when feature is disabled
2. ‚úÖ Show clear messages to users when features are unavailable
3. ‚úÖ Document all feature flags and their purposes
4. ‚úÖ Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
5. ‚úÖ Test both enabled and disabled states
6. ‚úÖ Clean up feature flags after full rollout
7. ‚úÖ Use descriptive flag names
8. ‚úÖ Default to safe/disabled state when appropriate

## Troubleshooting

**Feature flag not working:**
- ‚úì Check environment variable name starts with `REACT_APP_`
- ‚úì Verify value is exactly `'true'` or `'false'` (lowercase)
- ‚úì Restart development server after changing `.env`
- ‚úì Check browser console for errors
- ‚úì Verify build was created with correct environment variables

**Wrong behavior in production:**
- ‚úì Verify environment variables are set on hosting platform
- ‚úì Redeploy application after changing environment variables
- ‚úì Check build logs for environment variable values
- ‚úì Clear browser cache and reload

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Feature flags are embedded in the client-side code at build time. They are **publicly visible** in the browser.

- ‚ùå Do NOT use feature flags for security controls
- ‚ùå Do NOT put sensitive data in feature flags
- ‚úÖ Use feature flags only for feature visibility/availability
- ‚úÖ Implement actual security controls on the backend
- ‚úÖ Use feature flags for UX and functionality control only

## Monitoring

Consider tracking:
- Which features are enabled in each environment
- User interactions with disabled features
- Feature flag toggle history
- Impact on application usage

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Remote feature flag management
- [ ] Per-user feature flags
- [ ] Gradual percentage rollouts
- [ ] A/B testing support
- [ ] Feature flag analytics dashboard
